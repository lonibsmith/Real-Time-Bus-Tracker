# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Bus tracker from MIT To Harvard
Creates a tracker to generate new tokens showing the direction from MIT to Harvard. By clicking the button on the top of the page, the marker will move down the road showing the bus stops. I hope to eventually be able to add more to this map such as weather in the area, and a options to show the path to and from other locations.
